      <p class="lead">Below is a detailed self-reflection and practical plan for growth during B.Tech studies.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Strengths</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Strong fundamentals in algorithms and problem-solving.</li>
          <li>Hands-on build-first mentality (projects, labs).</li>
          <li>Quick learner, adaptable to new tools/languages.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Weaknesses & Observations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Limited exposure to industry-scale development practices.</li>
          <li>Occasional difficulty in time allocation between coursework and projects.</li>
          <li>Presentation and communication under pressure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How to overcome these:</strong> Tackle weaknesses with concrete micro-actions — contribute to OSS,
          create a study schedule, rehearse demo talks, and seek feedback from peers and mentors.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Opportunities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Internships, research projects, hackathons.</li>
          <li>Online specializations and certificate courses.</li>
          <li>Campus clubs and collaborative projects.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Challenges and Practical Mitigations</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Balancing learning & deadlines:</strong> Break tasks into 2-hour focused blocks and use
            retrospective reviews weekly.</li>
          <li><strong>Keeping motivation:</strong> Pair up with an accountability partner and set project milestones
            with small rewards.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited resources:</strong> Use free cloud tiers, community editions, and campus labs; document
            experiments diligently.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Group Discussion</h2>
        <img src="assets\images\gd.png" alt="Group Discussion" class="illustration">
        <p>Group Discussion (GD) is a crucial part of personal and professional development. It helps students build
          confidence in expressing their ideas, improves listening skills, and develops team spirit. GDs are important
          in campus placements as they evaluate clarity of thought, analytical reasoning, leadership, and the ability to
          collaborate effectively.</p>
        <p>By actively participating in group discussions, one learns how to respect diverse opinions, think critically,
          and present viewpoints in a structured and persuasive manner.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Open Extempore</h2>
        <img src="assets\images\extompore.png" alt="Extempore Speech" class="illustration">
        <p>Open Extempore is the art of speaking spontaneously on a given topic without prior preparation. It is a test
          of presence of mind, quick thinking, and clarity of expression. Extempore sessions encourage confidence,
          leadership, and the ability to handle pressure while conveying thoughts effectively.</p>
        <p>Participating in extempore enhances critical thinking, boosts communication, and prepares students for
          real-life scenarios such as interviews, presentations, and public speaking engagements.</p>
